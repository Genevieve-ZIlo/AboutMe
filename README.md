# AboutMe
My personal repository.

Let the world know a little bit more about you! What are you interested in learning? What are you working on? What's your favorite hobby?

Hi, I'm Genevieve Comer-Kleine.
I'm an 20 year old Uni student in Melbourne. Currently I am studying my Bachelor of Data Science and am in my second year. 

My fields of interest include:
- Deep Learning and Neural Networks: Last semster I devloped a CNN for classifying cancerous cells from a data set of Colon histopatholgy images. I hadn't worked with any sort of deep learning before and found it really interesting. I am now attempting to automate the detection and
extraction of individual cells from the original histology images with are much higer resolution.
- Data Visualization and Visual Analytics: Last semester I work on creating a series of data visualisations using R studio, I found this to be quite a fun avenue of Data Science as it allows for a lot of creativity, as well as heavy consideration of the ethics behind data, and data visualisations.
- Genomics - Sequence Alignment and Assembly: Before I started my degree, Genomics was on of the fields, that greatly interested me, specifically Sequence Alignment and Assembly, which is involves developing algorithms and tools to align and assemble these sequences, creating a complete representation of an organism's genome.

Right now I am working on extending my previous model as mention before, in order to detect and extract the individual cells from the original histology images. Thus far I i investigated using a Mask R-CNN framework, and have created a mock diagram to explore its architecture.
