Hi, I'm Genevieve Comer-Kleine, a 20-year-old university student in Melbourne. I'm currently studying my Bachelor of Data Science and I'm in my second year.

## <span style="color:#990000;">Fields of Interest</span>

### <span style="color:#009900;">Deep Learning and Neural Networks</span>

One of my areas of interest is deep learning and neural networks. In a recent semester, I developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify cancerous cells from a dataset of colon histopathology images. It was my first experience with deep learning, and I found it fascinating. Currently, I'm working on automating the detection and extraction of individual cells from higher-resolution histology images.


### <span style="color:#009900;">Data Visualization and Visual Analytics</span>

I also find data visualization and visual analytics quite intriguing. Last semester, I worked on creating a series of data visualizations using R Studio. This avenue of data science allows for creativity while also requiring careful consideration of the ethics behind data and data visualizations.

### <span style="color:#009900;">Genomics - Sequence Alignment and Assembly</span>

Before starting my degree, genomics was one of the fields that greatly interested me. In particular, I was fascinated by sequence alignment and assembly. This involves developing algorithms and tools to align and assemble DNA sequences, creating a complete representation of an organism's genome.

## <span style="color:#990000;">Current Project</span>

Currently, I'm extending my previous model to detect and extract individual cells from original histology images. I'm exploring the use of a Mask R-CNN framework and have created a mock diagram to explore its architecture.

## <span style="color:#990000;">Hobbies</span>

- Reading: I'm an avid reader, particularly enjoying fantasy novels and occasionally delving into classical literature. Some of my favorite authors include Robin Hobb, Mary Shelley, Oscar Wilde, Frank Herbert, and Brandon Sanderson.
- Snorkeling and Diving: Growing up in a small coastal town, I've developed a deep love for the ocean and enjoy any activities involving swimming.
- Book Binding: Recently, I've taken an interest in book binding, which has been a super fun hobby!
